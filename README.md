# Spell Checker Project

This spell checker project is an implementation of a basic spell checker in Python, created from scratch without relying on external libraries like NLTK or Levenshtein. The core functionality of this project is encapsulated within the `SpellChecker` class.

Dataset used in this code has been downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) you can access it using this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adarshpathak/shakespeare-text).

## Features

### 1. **Initialization (`__init__` method):**
   - The spell checker takes a text file path as input during object instantiation.
   - It reads the content of the text file, tokenizes it into words, and converts the words to lowercase.
   - The class creates a vocabulary set from the words in the text file to check the validity of words.
   - Additionally, it builds a dictionary that counts the frequency of each word in the text.

### 2. **Spell Correction Methods:**
   - `delete(self, word)`: Generates a list of words by deleting one letter at a time from the input word.
   - `replace(self, word)`: Generates a list of words by replacing each letter of the input word with all letters of the alphabet.
   - `insert(self, word)`: Generates a list of words by inserting one letter at a time at all positions in the input word.
   - `edit_one_letter(self, word)`: Combines the results of delete, replace, and insert methods to create a set of words that are one edit away from the input word.
   - `edit_two_letters(self, word)`: Applies `edit_one_letter` to the words generated by `edit_one_letter`, producing a set of words that are two edits away from the input word.

### 3. **Levenshtein Distance Calculation (`levenshtein_distance` method):**
   - Computes the Levenshtein distance between two strings (suggestion and target) using dynamic programming. Levenshtein distance represents the minimum number of single-character edits required to change one word into another.

### 4. **Auto Correct Method (`auto_correct`):**
   - Takes a word as input and checks if it is in the vocabulary.
   - If the word is in the vocabulary, it indicates that the word's spelling is correct.
   - If the word is not in the vocabulary, the spell checker calculates the probabilities of possible corrections based on the Levenshtein distance and word frequency.
   - Returns a sorted list of suggested corrections along with their probabilities.


This project demonstrates a fundamental implementation of a spell checker using techniques like Levenshtein distance and probability analysis. It showcases the core concepts of natural language processing without relying on external natural language processing libraries.
